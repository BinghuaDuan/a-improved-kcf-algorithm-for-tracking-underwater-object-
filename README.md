# a-improved-kcf-algorithm-for-tracking-underwater-object-
1. This is a project completed in my sencond to fourth grade of university. 
2. It contains the implementation of related filtering algorithms.
   In addition to the algorithm I proposed, other algorithms are mainly for baseline as my patent and thesis. 
3. All of these codes were originally written by C++. 
   Then, in order to better show the effect of implementation, they were rewritten with MATLAB again.
4. Because the data is secret, so I am sorry that we can't provide the data.
