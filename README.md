* [patent]: CN201810870281.4 一种基于前视声纳的改进核相关滤波水下目标跟踪方法
* [paper]: An Improved Kernelized Corralation Filter Algorithm For Underwater Target Tracking 
1. This is a project completed in my sencond to fourth grade of university. 
2. It contains the implementation of related filtering algorithms.
   In addition to the algorithm I proposed, other algorithms are mainly for baseline as my patent and thesis. 
3. All of these codes were originally written by C++. 
   Then, in order to better show the effect of implementation, they were rewritten with MATLAB again.
4. Because the data is secret, so I am sorry that we can't provide the data.if you have any problem ,welcome to contact me.
